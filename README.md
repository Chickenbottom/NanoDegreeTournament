The design of the database is not what I would have preferred the I adjusted it do work the tournament.py. 
My oringal design I spread out the tables a bit more in order to make attending multple tournaments easier.
It was getting a little too complex to get it work with tournament.py. 

I hard coded the name location and dates of the tournament, I would have programmed that information to be passed into 
some of the functions to make provide the ability to have multiple tournaments.
